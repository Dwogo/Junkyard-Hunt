# Junkyard-Hunt
It's like the Lucky Unicorn game but made in rust so it's rust themed

### How it works

The player starts with $10 (Ingame)
Each round costs 1 dollar

First the program asks the player their name
Then it automatically plays the first round
Your can either win steel, iron, or just rust
Then it will ask if you want to continue
If you cant afford another round the program will stop
